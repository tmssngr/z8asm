# Z8ASM

Z8ASM is, as the name suggests, a (simple) assembler for the Zilog Z8 processor.

The main class is [Main](src/main/src/Main.java).
It accepts the `.asm` file as input and writes the compiled binary file to `output.bin`.

Please see directory `src/main/src/examples` for example files used to build internal ROM, ROM and video ROM for the JU+TE computer (east-german computer from 1988).
